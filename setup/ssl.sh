# SSL Certificate
#
# Create a self-signed SSL certificate if one has not yet been created.
#
# The certificate is for PRIMARY_HOSTNAME specifically and is used for:
#
#  * IMAP
#  * SMTP submission (port 587) and opportunistic TLS (when on the receiving end)
#  * the DNSSEC DANE TLSA record for SMTP
#  * HTTPS (for PRIMARY_HOSTNAME only)
#
# When other domains besides PRIMARY_HOSTNAME are served over HTTPS,
# we generate a domain-specific self-signed certificate in the management
# daemon (web_update.py) as needed.
