# Spam filtering with spamassassin via spampd
#############################################

# spampd sits between postfix and dovecot. It takes mail from postfix
# over the LMTP protocol, runs spamassassin on it, and then passes the
# message over LMTP to dovecot for local delivery.

# In order to move spam automatically into the Spam folder we use the dovecot sieve
# plugin. The tools/mail.py tool creates the necessary sieve script for each mail
# user when the mail user is created.

source /etc/mailinabox.conf # get global vars
source setup/functions.sh # load our functions

# Install packages.

# Allow spamassassin to download new rules.

# Pass messages on to docevot on port 10026.
# This is actually the default setting but we don't want to lose track of it.
# We've already configured Dovecot to listen on this port.

# Enable the Dovecot antispam plugin to detect when a message moves between folders so we can
# pass it to sa-learn for training. (Be careful if we use multiple plugins later.)
