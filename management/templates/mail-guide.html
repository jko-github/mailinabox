			<p>When you set up your email on your phone, desktop, or other device, you will be asked to choose a protocol.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>On Android devices, look for IMAP and SMTP.</li>

					<table class="table">
					<thead>
						<tr><th>Protocol</th> <th>Port</th> <th>Options</th></tr>

					<tr><th>IMAP</th> <td>993</td> <td>SSL</td></tr>
					<tr><th>SMTP</th> <td>587</td> <td>STARTTLS <span>(&ldquo;always&rdquo; or &ldquo;required&rdquo;, if prompted)</span></td></tr>

					<p>On iOS devices and devices on this <a href="http://z-push.org/compatibility/">compatibility list</a>, set up your mail as an Exchange or ActiveSync server. Use these settings when prompted:</p>

			<h3>Other information about mail on your box</h3>

			<h4>Greylisting</h4>
			<p>Your box using a technique called greylisting to cut down on spam. Greylisting works by delaying mail from people you haven&rsquo;t received mail from before for up to about 10 minutes. The vast majority of spam gets tricked by this. If you are waiting for an email from someone new, such as if you are registering on a new website and are waiting for an email confirmation, please give it up to 10-15 minutes to arrive.</p>

			<h4>Use this box to send as you</h4>
			<p>Your box sets strict email sending policies for your domain names to make it harder for spam and other fraudulent mail to claim to be you. Only this machine is authorized to send email on behalf of your domain names. If you use any other service to send email as you, it will likely get spam filtered by recipients.</p>
